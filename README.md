# Narrabundah-College-Website

Hello! I thought I might have a go at trying to make a website that actually looks good *, so I made a website featuring my old school, Narrabundah College.

[See the webpage here!](https://averyinterestingusername.github.io/Narrabundah-College-Website/Home.html)

The website has multiple pages, each about a different block of the school. You can navigate to each one using ither 
- The buttons at the top of each page.
- The labeled map on the Home webpage (Click on a block, it'll take you there).

The Home webpage also contains an animation of the college logo and an iFrame, where you can see pretty pictures of the school grounds. :)

You can also switch the CSS styling if you prefer another one.

### * _I_ think it looks good.
