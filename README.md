# Narrabundah-College-Website

Hello! I thought I might have a go at trying to make a website that actually looks good *, so I made a website featuring my old school, Narrabundah College.

[See the webpage here!](https://averyinterestingusername.github.io/Narrabundah-College-Website/Home.html)

The website has multiple pages, each about a different block of the school. You can navigate to each one...

* _I_ think it looks good.
